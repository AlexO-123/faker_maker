# Audit logs

It might be useful to collect the history of all the fakes generated by your factories. FakerMaker allows you to stream (or write to a file) all the instances it builds for you. This is optional and disabled by default.

## Enable logging

By default audit logging is disabled. The default output stream is `STDOUT`. The output target can either be an object that responds to `puts`, or be a string which will be interpreted as a file location to use to write to. If file path string is used, it will be opened in 'append' mode.

```ruby
FakerMaker.configure do |config|
  config.audit = true
  config.audit_destination = '/tmp/faker_maker_audit_logs'
end
```
